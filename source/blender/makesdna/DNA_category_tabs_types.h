 * Per-editor state for the Category Tabs / Tag Bar system.

 * This state used to be duplicated as a flat set of fields across every editor
 * that hosts a Tag Bar (View3D, SpaceProperties, SpaceImage, SpaceNode). It is
 * collected here into a single embeddable struct so the fields, their RNA
 * registration and versioning live in one place. Editors embed it as
 * ``CategoryTabsState tabs_state``; the RNA layer exposes the members under the
 * historical property names via ``tabs_state.<field>`` sdna paths, so the Python
 * API (``space.tag_filter_enabled`` etc.) is unchanged.
