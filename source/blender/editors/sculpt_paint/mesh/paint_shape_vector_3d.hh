 * Live Vector shape session of Sculpt Mode (the 3D counterpart of the Image Editor's
 * `paint_image_shape_vector.cc`). The session is owned by #SculptSession (a runtime pointer,
 * exactly like `CurvePatchSession`), drives the Image-canvas write backend with a live preview,
 * and is edited through the shared #ShapeVectorEditor / #VectorEditHost core.
 *
 * A Sculpt Vector session is always SurfaceAnchored: the shape lives in the tangent plane of the
 * surface under the first press, so the overlay and the gesture mapping reproject through the live
 * view and navigation passes through (the session follows the view; it never auto-Applies on it).
