 * Build the two bases a Normal-channel write needs for one UV primitive.

 * A normal map sample is a direction in the frame the DECAL is laid out in, while the destination
 * map stores directions in the frame the SURFACE's UV parametrization defines. Both have to be
 * known before one can be expressed in the other, and both are constant across a UV primitive --
 * so this is called once per pixel row, not once per texel.
 *
 * \param tri_tangent, tri_bitangent_sign: The primitive's UV tangent and handedness, from
 * #UVPrimitives.
 * \param tri_positions: The primitive's three object-space corners, in winding order.
 * \param view_right: Fallback in-plane direction for a primitive whose screen projection is
 * degenerate (edge-on), where the screen basis cannot be derived.
 * \param region, projection_mat: The view the decal is laid out in for a brush-mapped source.
 * \a region may be null, in which case the \a view_right fallback is used throughout; a caller
 * whose decal has a frame of its own does not need the screen basis at all.
 * \param r_t_screen, r_b_screen: Screen right/up projected onto the surface -- the decal frame a
 * brush-mapped normal source is authored in.
 * \param r_n_m, r_t_m, r_b_m: The surface's own tangent basis, the frame the map is written in.
