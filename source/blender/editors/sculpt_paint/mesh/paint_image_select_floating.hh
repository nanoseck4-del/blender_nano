 * State and helpers shared by the four floating tools (move / transform / gradient / warp).
 *
 * Each tool keeps a heap-allocated state object alive on #SpaceImage_Runtime::paint_select for as
 * long as its edit is floating. The state structs used to repeat the same members and the same
 * lifetime plumbing (draw-handle removal, cursor restore, "is something floating in this space"
 * predicates); that shared part lives in #PaintSelectFloatingSession, which all four derive from.
 *
 * #PaintSelectSession holds exactly one of them at a time, so the tag on the base
 * (#PaintSelectFloatingSession::tool) is what identifies which tool the live session belongs to.
 * The accessors below are the only sanctioned way in and out of that slot.
 *
 * The base is deliberately non-polymorphic: every state object is created with #MEM_new and
 * destroyed with #MEM_delete through its *concrete* type, so no virtual destructor is needed and
 * none must be added. #image_select_floating_session_free bridges the gap by dispatching on the
 * tag to the owning tool.
 *
 * NOTE: This header is included from #paint_image_select_intern.hh, which is what consumers
 * should include.
