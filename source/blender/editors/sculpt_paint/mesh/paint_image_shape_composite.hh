 * Compositor of the Image Editor shape drawing tools: rasterizes shapes into coverage and
 * writes it into the paint targets (the Canvas image, or the PBR paint channel images), with
 * one image undo step per bake.
 *
 * Every bake is self-contained: symmetry copies are derived here, the affected regions are the
 * union over all shapes (the copies included), fill is composited before stroke, profiles and
 * the selection mask are applied per pixel. Rasterization runs in row strips to keep peak
 * memory low on large tiles.
 *
 * The Pixel operators resolve their targets from the context (#shape_bake); the Vector session
 * passes its own stored targets (#shape_composite_into), so a session bakes into the editor
 * that owns it no matter which context drives the commit.
