/** \file

 *
 * Blending rules shared by the two material paint engines: the raster one that writes image maps
 * (sculpt_paint_image.cc, and the Image Editor's 2D path) and the vertex one that writes mesh
 * attributes (sculpt_paint_material.cc).
 *
 * \note What is deliberately *not* shared is how each engine accumulates a stroke.
 *
 * Both engines composite a per-stroke coverage accumulator against a frozen pre-stroke value,
 * because re-blending an already-blended value makes overlapping dabs of one stroke compound -
 * banding where their falloffs meet, and runaway saturation for modes like Add. They differ only
 * in where those two things come from: the vertex engine reads the pre-stroke value from the
 * sculpt undo step and keys the accumulator by vertex (#StrokeCache::material_mix_scalars), while
 * the raster engine captures it per texel on first touch and keys the accumulator by texel block
 * (#paint::image::MaterialStrokeAccum).
 *
 * The raster engine keeps one shortcut: Mix converges when applied dab after dab, so it skips the
 * accumulator and blends straight into the live image, where the image undo system preserves the
 * pre-stroke state. That shortcut is only valid for Mix.
 *
 * Only the per-element math below is common, and it lives here so the two engines cannot drift
 * apart on what a channel value *means*.
