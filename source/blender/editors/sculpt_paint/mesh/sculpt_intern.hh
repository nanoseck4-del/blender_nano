 * deliberately not persisted (see #bke::sculpt_layers::rec_exempt_set), and memfile undo goes
 * through that same writer and reader, so a memfile restore leaves the tree unexempted.

 * Re-deriving from the live session settles all of those the same way. #commit_layers_change calls
 * this on every path that can restore an undo step, and #stroke_record_begin calls it again at the

 *   contribution with the weights in force at flush time, so a flush landing after the flip would
 *   subtract an unmasked contribution the evaluator had composed masked, denting the base by the
 *   difference — permanently.
 * - The runtime base is derived from the still-consistent pre-change state, and only then does the
 *   flag move, the exemption follow it and the surface recompose.
 *
 * Arming also pins the active layer to enabled with influence 1.0, which is REC's contract with the

 * True when \a sculpt_brush_type must be refused because a weight-mask editing session is open.
 *
 * Pure, so the decision is testable without a #bContext or a live session: pass
 * #mask_edit_active_uid for \a mask_edit_uid.
 *
 * A session is entered to paint a mask, so the brushes that only write attributes — the Mask brush
 * above all, but Paint/Smear/Blur and Draw Face Sets equally — must keep working; they are what the
 * session exists to borrow. Everything else moves vertices, and while a session is open the
 * standard mask storage does not hold the user's mask, so a moved vertex would be displaced by the
 * *layer's weights* wherever a brush consults the mask (automasking, the mask factor every brush
 * multiplies its strength by). The stroke would be authored against a mask the user cannot see and
 * did not paint, and no exit path can undo a stroke that was already applied.
 *
 * Note that this is *not* a "keeps the CCG clean" rule: the attribute-only brushes tag multires
 * just as the position brushes do (#flush_update_step calls #multires_mark_as_modified for every
 * dab on a multires object, before it branches on the update type), so `SubdivCCG::dirty.coords` is
 * set throughout a grid session either way. Keeping the layer's weights out of the base mesh is the
 * job of #bke::sculpt_layers::MaskEditSuspendGuard inside the flush primitives, not of this test.
 *
 * Refused rather than closing the session for them: ending it silently would throw away an
 * in-progress mask edit as a side effect of an unrelated action.
 *
 * Keyed on what the brush *writes* (#brush_type_is_attribute_only), not on its name or category, so
 * a new position brush is refused by default rather than by being remembered.
