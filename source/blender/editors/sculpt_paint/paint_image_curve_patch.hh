 * Live 2D Curve Patch session for the Image Editor (SPACE_IMAGE, SI_MODE_PAINT,
 * PaintMode::Texture2D).
 *
 * The session owns the canonical UV-space edit curve (#bke::CurvesGeometry) for one in-progress
 * patch, plus everything that must survive across restore-and-re-stamp cycles without rewriting
 * pixels more than once. It is intentionally NOT a DNA / RNA data-block -- it is editor runtime
 * state, the same way the 3D Sculpt Curve Patch session lives on `SculptSession`. Modal hit
 * testing and overlay drawing (Stage 7) call back into
 * #image_curve_patch_session_active_get() to discover the live session.
 *
 * Lifetime: bound to the editor's brush modal handler. Born at the end of the anchor stroke
 * (Stage 6), adopted by the modal operator (Stage 7) for editing, and destroyed either on Enter
 * (commit) or on Esc / wrong context (cancel).
