 * Runtime Vector document: the editable list of shape items a Vector session works on, plus the
 * session-local undo history. No target, no context: the session (`paint_shape_edit.hh`) and the
 * frontends drive it, and the persistence ID  will serialize it.
 *
 * The undo history holds STATES with a cursor, mirroring #CurvePatchDocument::undo_steps: entry
 * 0 is the state the document started in and a new snapshot truncates any redo branch above the
 * cursor. Not a stack of deltas.
 *
 * Invariant: at rest (no gesture in flight) `undo_steps[undo_step_current]` equals the live
 * #VectorDocument::items. A gesture mutates the live items and, on a successful end, records the
 * post-state with #vector_document_undo_push; on cancel the caller restores the entry at the
 * cursor. #vector_document_undo_push is therefore called AFTER a change.
