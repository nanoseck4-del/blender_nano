 *
 * Modal operator for editing a live Curve Patch control curve (see design doc). Started
 * automatically right after a `BRUSH_STROKE_CURVE_PATCH` anchor stroke finishes (Stage 05).
 *
 * A single, persistent modal operator (`SCULPT_OT_curve_patch_edit`) owns every event for the
 * whole live-edit session -- point/handle/segment/radius drag, insert, delete, texture-axis
 * toggle, and Enter/Esc commit/cancel. Mouse interaction stays as `switch (event->type)` because
 * hit-tests depend on cursor position. Keyboard actions go through a `WM_modalkeymap` attached to
 * this operator (`paint_curve_patch_edit_keymap.cc`), the same pattern as `PAINTCURVE_OT_slide`.
 * Session-local undo lives in `paint_curve_patch_edit_undo.cc`; multi-viewport context sync in
 * `paint_curve_patch_edit_sync.cc`.
 *
 * That is NOT a tool `wmKeyMap` of small operators. An earlier version split each action into its
 * own short-lived operator bound via a procedural C++ keymap; that left the installed keymap with
 * zero items at dispatch time (`WM_keymap_poll()` warning "empty keymap 'Curve Patch Edit'").
 * Blender's key-config merge is built around keymaps a Python preset knows about. A modal keymap
 * assigned to the operator type does not go through that path; bindings live in
 * `blender_default.py` so merge cannot empty the map, and so the user can rebind them.
 *
 * Entire-point drag uses the shared 3D cores (`paintcurve_apply_point_surface_snap`,
 * `paintcurve_object_delta_from_screen_drag`). Radius drag uses
 * `paintcurve_radius_from_handle_screen_pos`. Handle drag stays local: Paint Curve slide also
 * rotates the opposite handle and rewrites Free/Align; this editor only promotes computed
 * Auto/Vector to Align so a user-chosen Free stays free. Segment hit-tests and insert are the
 * `_from_geometry` cores in `paint_curve_sync.cc`. Overlay handles come from
 * `ED_paint_curve_screen_handles_build_from_geometry` (`paint_curve_draw.cc`).
