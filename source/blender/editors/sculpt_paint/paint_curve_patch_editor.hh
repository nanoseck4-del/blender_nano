 *
 * The modal editing core of a live Curve Patch: hit testing, the four drags, insert / append, the
 * hotkeys and the context menu -- everything that is the same wherever the patch is being stamped.
 *
 * Not an operator. Each target registers its own modal operator, puts one of these in
 * `op->customdata`, and forwards events to #CurvePatchCurveEditor::handle_event. What the core
 * cannot know it asks its two collaborators: #CurvePatchEditorHost for the target (what the curve
 * is, how to re-stamp it, how the session ends) and #CurvePatchScreenAdapter for the space the
 * cursor lives in (how to project the curve, where a click lands).
 *
 * A target keeps whatever the core returns #Status::Unhandled for. That is how 3D Sculpt Mode
 * keeps its surface snapping, its Transform G/R/S hand-off and its modal keymap without any of
 * that leaking in here.
