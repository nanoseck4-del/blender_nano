 * What Curve Patch editing needs to know about the target it acts on, and nothing else.
 *
 * Two interfaces, because the two callers need different amounts. #CurvePatchHost is what an
 * action body (`paint_curve_patch_actions.hh`) needs; #CurvePatchEditorHost adds what the modal
 * editor (`paint_curve_patch_editor.hh`) needs on top -- session lifetime, the live-brush
 * watchdog, the context menu. A target can implement the first without the second, which is how
 * 3D Sculpt Mode shares the action bodies while still running its own modal.
 *
 * One implementation per target: `SculptCurvePatchHost` (`paint_curve_patch_edit.cc`) and
 * `ImageCurvePatchHost` (`paint_image_curve_patch_edit.cc`).
